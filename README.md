# USIU First-Year Companion (v1) 🎓

A lightweight, interactive web application designed to help USIU first-year students during Orientation Week. This companion provides a personalized greeting, campus cost estimator, and budget-friendly tips.

## Project Overview

**What:** A static microsite that helps new students estimate weekly campus expenses (transport and snacks) and provides smart budgeting tips.

**Why:** To give incoming USIU students a practical tool for financial planning during their orientation, making the transition to university life smoother and more manageable.

**Who:** Built for USIU Student Affairs office to support first-year students, particularly those commuting from areas like Thika Road and surrounding neighborhoods.

## Features ✨

1. **Personalized Greeting** - Welcomes students by name with Swahili "Karibu" message
2. **Cost Estimator** - Calculates weekly transport and snack expenses with realistic KSh amounts
3. **Budget Optimizer** - Shows 10% savings potential with actionable tips
4. **Theme Toggle** - Switch between day/night modes for comfortable viewing
5. **Auto Theme** - Automatically sets theme based on time of day (6 PM - 6 AM = dark mode)
6. **Reset Function** - Clear calculations to start fresh
7. **Console Logging** - Comprehensive debugging information for development

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup with proper structure
- **CSS3** - Responsive design with CSS variables and mobile-first approach
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks, only ES6 features
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment with Nginx Alpine
- **Nginx** - Lightweight web server for static content

## Running with Docker 🐳

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

### Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t usiu-first-year:v1 .
```

### Run the Container
```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 usiu-first-year:v1
```

### Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Stop the Container
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or:
```bash
docker ps                    # Find container ID
docker stop <container-id>   # Stop the container

2. Answer four prompts:
   - Days per week on campus (e.g., 3)
   - Transport cost per trip in KSh (e.g., 120 for Thika Road commute)
   - Number of snacks per day (e.g., 2)
   - Average snack price in KSh (e.g., 80)
3. View your weekly cost breakdown and savings tip

### Changing Theme
- Click **"🌓 Toggle Theme"** to switch between light and dark modes
- Theme automatically sets based on time: dark mode 6 PM - 6 AM

### Resetting
- Click **"🔄 Reset"** to clear the summary and start over

## Development Notes 🔧

### JavaScript Concepts Used (Lesson 1)
- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types (String, Number)
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Comparison operators
- String concatenation and template literals
- `prompt()` for user input
- `alert()` for notifications
- `console.log()` for debugging
- DOM manipulation (`getElementById`, `textContent`, `innerText`)
- Event listeners (`addEventListener`)
- `Number()` type conversion
- Basic conditional logic (`if/else`)

### Debugging
Open browser DevTools (F12) to view console logs:
- Student name entry
- All calculator inputs and outputs
- Theme changes
- Reset actions

All key operations are logged with clear labels for easy debugging.

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements 🚧

### Current Limitations
1. **No Data Persistence** - Calculations are lost on page refresh (by design, no localStorage in v1)
2. **Prompt-Based Input** - Uses browser prompts instead of modern forms
3. **No Input Validation** - Basic type checking only, no range validation
4. **Static Content** - No backend, database, or user accounts
5. **Single User** - No multi-user support or saved profiles
6. **No Currency Conversion** - KSh only, no international support

### Next Steps (v2 Planning)
1. **Replace Prompts with Forms** - Better UX with HTML form inputs and validation
2. **Add Local Storage** - Save calculations between sessions
3. **Enhanced Calculator** - Add meal plans, books, housing, and other expenses
4. **Data Visualization** - Charts showing expense breakdown
5. **Comparison Tool** - Compare costs for different commute routes
6. **Tips Database** - Expandable tips with categories
7. **Responsive Enhancements** - PWA support for offline access
8. **Backend Integration** - Save user profiles and historical data
9. **Social Features** - Share tips, connect with other students
10. **Admin Dashboard** - Student Affairs can update content

## Academic Integrity 🎯

This project includes USIU-specific context:
- Realistic Kenyan Shilling amounts for transport and snacks
- References to Thika Road commute (common USIU route)
- Local context (carpooling, campus cafes, student discounts)
- Personalized output with student name and timestamp
- Budget tips tailored to USIU student lifestyle

**Generated for:** [Your Student ID will appear in the app output]

Example personalization: "Try reducing snack purchases by bringing home-made snacks 2 days/week" instead of generic savings advice.
